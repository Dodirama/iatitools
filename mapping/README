IATI Mapping
============

There are three files in this folder:
* ISO-DAC-Countries-Regions.csv - which contains mapping between countries and regions, including DAC country and region codes, ISO2 and ISO3 country codes.

Spine Mapping
-------------

The "Spine" is intended to be a best-fit mapping between different sectoral classifications and to country budgets. This is still very much a work in progress and complete, and there are a lot of sectoral classifications that are not covered under the Spine. There are two files here:
* spine-dac-crs.csv maps DAC CRS Sector codes to the Spine
* spine-wbsectors.csv maps WB Sector codes to the Spine

Please use both of these files with caution. They are not intended to be authoritative!

Google Refine Commands 
----------------------

GOOGLE REFINE COMMANDS contains details of the Google Refine commands that you can run on IATI CSV files after creating them, for normalising the data:
* Map countries to regions
* Convert currency to EUR (GBP->EUR and USD->EUR)
* Add Spine mapping to Sectors
* Remove Z from the end of DFID dates
* Delete all rows where vocabulary is WBTheme (accidentally brought in on import, will be removed later)

===================

Concatenating CSV files
-----------------------

In Linux you can use this command in the terminal to concatenate (stick together) a large number of CSV files:
cat *.csv > newfile.csv

Note that this will retain the headers of each CSV file as well, so you might then want to load it into Refine and delete those header rows which remain.
